Working on combining Yolov3 with Flownet for video object detection.

The part of yolov3 is modified from: https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3

The part of flownet is modified from: https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch

This project have not finished.

The weight will be provide in future for human detection and VID dataset.
